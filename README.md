This is a project where I explore and test how to make a web server on my computer and host an API from it.

## About
This is a client-side website that provides a GUI for users to navigate and use the API hosted on my webserver.

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

1. A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)- preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to view code on your computer if you wish to download.

2. Node.js with NVM. To install on your computer, follow the instructions here [Node.js](https://github.com/itp-dwd/2020-spring/blob/master/guides/installing-nodejs.md)

<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
<!-- Write instructions on how to start working on your project -->
<!-- Notes about the deployment -->
## Deployment

This project is hosted on Glitch. You can visit the rendered website [here](https://jlizardo019-firstapi.glitch.me/)

### Built with

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Github](https://github.com)
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Plant API JSON](https://github.com/android/sunflower/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/plants.json)
* [NeDB] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/nedb)
* [Postman] (https://www.postman.com/)

### Process

1. I installed npm on my computer.

2. I created a folder to store all my webserver files and created a file called server.js that requires express, nedb, and fs libraries.

3. I wrote code to accept the different possible HTTP requests (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) that I want my server to account for.

5. In my Command Line, I ran the code <code>node start</code> to activate my server.

5. I tested the HTTP requests locally using Postman to make sure my code was working properly.

6. I set up my my html and css for the client side website, creating a simple interface.

7. I deployed the website on Glitch.
